# A grammar of graphics

.largeish[
The grammar of graphics is a framework for constructing statistical graphics in a principled way. 
The grammar defines an explicit relationship between the variables in your data you have and the graphic or plot you wish to represent. It was first defined by Lee Wilkinson and extended by Hadley Wickham in the R package `ggplot2`. 

Here we uncover how the charts you know by name can be created via `ggplot2`, learn how to construct a `ggplot2` graphic and then build a plot up, layer-by-layer.
]

<br>

## Why use the grammar of graphics?

.largeish[
The grammar of graphics allows you to __define__ the mapping between variables in the data, with elements of the plot. It allows us to see and understand __how__ plots are similar or different. 

The grammar also helps you see how variations in the definition create variations in the plot. Using named plots, for example a pie chart, bar chart, scatterplot, in some ways is like seeing animals in the zoo.

# Example data

### World Health Organisation (WHO) tuberculosis case notifications data 

.large[To showcase `ggplot2` we will build graphics using a data set provided by the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://www.who.int/). This is current tuberculosis (TB) case notifications aggregated by __country__, __gender__ and __age__ group. We have tidied up this data for you and saved it in the R data storage format.]

XXX how to share data? update download?
Before making your way through this step, we strongly recommend that you [download the data set](https://github.com/datascienceprogram/ids_course_data/blob/master/data/tb_tidy.rds) and then place it in your project folder on your computer.

.largeish[
The data consists of six columns:

* __country:__ the country where the TB case(s) occured
* __iso3:__ a three letter standardised country code
* __year:__ the year when the TB case(s) occured
* __gender:__ whether the TB case(s) belonged to males or females.
* __age_group:__ whether the TB case(s) belonged to someone aged between 15 to 24, 25 to 34,
35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64 or 65 and above
* __count:__ the total number of TB cases for a given country, year, gender and age group.

# A first look

.largeish[Let's create charts from the TB data to find out if there are differences between age groups, and gender between TB cases in Australia.

We start with a 100% chart, that compares the proportion of TB cases in each age group by gender.]

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")

We start with a 100% chart, that compares the proportion of TB cases in each age group by gender.]

<br>

## What can you learn from a 100% chart? 

.largeish[
There are three key lessons from this chart:

 * The focus is on **proportion** in each category. 
 * Across (almost) all ages, and years, the proportion of males having TB is higher than females
 * These proportions tend to be higher in the older age groups, for all years.

# Building your own ggplot

.largeish[We start building a ggplot2 graphic with the function `ggplot()`, passing a *data set* and an *aesthetic mapping* as arguments to the function. 
The *aesthetic mapping* (or *variable mapping*) is constructed with the function `aes()`, telling `ggplot()` which variable in our data should correspond to a particular graphical element to be drawn.]

### Example

```{r}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender))
```

.large[The first argument provided is the name of the data, `tb_au`. And the variable mapping consists of three elements, the variable:]

.largeish[
- __year__ will be mapped to the x-axis, 
- __count__ will be mapped to the y-axis  
- __gender__ will be mapped to the fill element (it will be the colour)
]

.largeish[This generates a blank plot, we still need to tell ggplot what geometric shape to draw!]

- `stat = "identity"` says no need to compute the count (it is already counted in the data)

`ggplot` automatically draws a legend, but you may want might want to change the colour of the bars to accommodate colour blindness. This can be done with a `scale` element, and here we use a palette from [colorbrewer.org](colorbrewer.org).

  facet_grid(. ~ age_group) #<<
  
```

.largeish[
Finally we create a bar chart for each age group present in the TB notifactions, which you can do by adding a `facet` element. A `facet` creates subplots for each category (or combination of categories) laid out in a grid. The argument is specified as a *formula*, and is of the form left hand side ~ right hand side

---

To summarise, you have created your first `ggplot` one layer at a time. Once you become more confident you will be able to start building everything up at once. Your completed chart should resemble the following:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
p
```

---

# Counts vs proportions


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```


## What we learn from this chart? 

.largeish[
- Focus on **counts**, it shows that counts are different across __ages__, and __years__: counts tend to be lower in middle age (45-64). 
- Shows that in the year 1999, there was a bit of a TB outbreak in most age groups, with numbers doubling or tripling compared to other years. The TB Incidence has been increasing among younger age groups in recent years.
]

---

## Give it a go!

You can make this bar chart using `ggplot2` by changing the position argument
in `geom_bar()` to `stack`, with the following code chunk: 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
p
```

---

### Going from 'stacked' to 'side-by-side'

What if you wanted to show the counts in each age category but with respect to __gender__, as shown in the following chart:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## What can you learn from this chart? 

The focus is now on counts by gender, and shows predominantly male incidence of TB. You can also see that incidence among males relative to females is from middle age onwards. There appears to be
similar incidence between males and females in younger age groups.

Again, let's think about what's changed from your previous charts. The colours, aesthetics and facets have remained the same, it's just the __position__ of the bars that have been altered 

---

For your own bar chart, you can achieve this using `ggplot2` by changing the position argument in `geom_bar()` to `dodge`, with the following code chunk:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
p
```

---

## Going from 'side to side' to 'separate bars'

You also might be interested in looking at how the incidence changes within a gender over time and age groups, as shown in the following chart: 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

## What do you learn? 

It's now easier to focus separately on males and females. You can see that the 1999 outbreak of TB mostly affected males. There is also growing incidence in the 25-34 age group is still affecting females which  seems to be have stablised for males.

---

## What changes in the code? 

You may have noticed you are facetting on additional variable: gender. You also no longer require a position argument, since there is only one bar per category.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
p
```

Rainbow, rose and pie charts are other types of graphical plot you can use to visualise your data, and with a few changes to your `ggplot2` code you can make a drastically different chart. 

---

Consider the following rainbow chart:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) 
```

The chart is visually appealling, but it's difficult to interpret. In what way could use `ggplot2` to make the chart easier to interpet?  

---

Notice how the aesthetic mappings are different, __year__ is now mapped to the colour of the bar and a single number _(not a variable)_ is mapped to __x__, that results in a single stacked bar chart. You can change __year__ to be a category rather than a number (by using `factor()`):

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
rainbow <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) 
rainbow
```

---

## Changing coordinates

You can further manipulate the chart by changing the cartesian coordinates to __polar__ which will then lay everything out in __circles__, rather than __rectangles__. 

When you use polar coordinates, one axis is mapped to an __angle__, rather than a position, as shown in the following rose chart:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  coord_polar() 
```

The __year__ (which was laid out on the x-axis) now corresponds to an angle around a circle going clockwise, rather than a straight line. 

__This layout makes it easier to interpret how the chart emphasises the middle age groups as having low incidence accross the years.__

---

The code looks the same as the separate bar chart example, with an additional specification `coord_polar()`:


```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
p <- ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age_group) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  coord_polar() 
p
```

---

## Transform from rainbox to pie

You can continue to use polar coordinates to modify your rainbow chart and transform it to a pie chart. 

The code is the same as before, but this time you want to have the __y-axis__ represent the __angle__ around the circle. You can do this with `coord_polar(theta = "y")`:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
rainbow +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```

By doing this, you get another pretty chart that's difficult to interpret and unuseful for making comparisons across age groups. 


---

### Re-arrange conditioning

Proximity is a a really powerful tool. Knowing how to effectively use facet, and colour to map different variables, will improve your data plots, out of this world!

```{r compare counts of ages, fig.height=12, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#ggplot(tb_fr, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=age)) +
#  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
#  facet_wrap(sex~age, ncol=2) +
#  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") +
#  scale_x_continuous("year", breaks=seq(1995, 2012, 5), labels=c("95", "00", "05", "10"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Not what we want
- Same information as previous
- We'd like to directly compare male femal for each year, and age, side-by-side bar chart
```

We want to focus on differences between sexes, and alternatively also differences between ages. To make it easier, we'll reduce the time period to just one year, 2012. 

---

```{r focus on one year gender, side-by-side bars of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
tb_au %>% filter(year == 2012) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=count, fill=gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") + 
  facet_wrap(~age_group, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") +
  ggtitle("Arrangement A")
```

---

```{r focus on one year age, side-by-side bars of age group, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
tb_au %>% filter(year == 2012) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=age_group, y=count, fill=age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") + 
  facet_wrap(~gender, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") +
  ggtitle("Arrangement B")
```



We've got two different rearrangements of the same information. 

What do we learn? That is different from each? What's the focus of each? What's easy, what's harder?

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Arrangement A makes it easier to directly compare male and female counts, separately for each age group. Generally, male counts are higher than female counts. There is a big difference between counts in the 45-54 age group, and over 65 counts are almost the same.
- Arrangement B makes it easier to directly compare counts by age group, separately for females and males. For females, incidence drops in the middle years. For males, it is pretty consistently high across age groups. 
```

### Discussion

- Grammar of graphics makes rearranging easy
- Its good to look at the data in many different ways [Unwin, Hofmann and Cook](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013/RJ-2013-012/RJ-2013-012.pdf)
