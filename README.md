# An Introduction to the Visualisation Ecosystem in R

By Ursula Laa and Stuart Lee


The modern data analysis cycle requires incorporating and iterating through
many visualisations, as you try to understand both your data and fit your models.
Visualisation also plays a key role in communicating your results to your 
collaborators and colleagues. In this seminar, we will introduce contemporary 
R packages for visualisation that we have found useful in our work. We will
provide examples of using ggplot2, and its extensions as well as building
interactive plots, reports and dashboards.
